AHF: AMIGA Halo Finder plus added NChilada file support.

Fork of v1.0-116, from here: http://popia.ft.uam.es/AHF/download.html

Added support to read NChilada files as written by ChaNGa.

For NChilada files, need to use input parameter "ic_filetype"       = 110

Input parameter "ic_filename" should be set to the directory that contains "description.xml"
